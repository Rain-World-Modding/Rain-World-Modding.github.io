# Partiality Mods

Gone are the days of Partiality being the primary mod loader for the Rain World modding community, but RW BepInEx still supports Partiality mods. For installation instructions, see the [BepInEx](/pages/using-mods/BepInEx.html) page.

The authority for Rain World Partiality mods is [Topicular's Guide to Partiality Modding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZE6EVwslhnSIFffmoUxDgUCRTAvD-zP/view). While some aspects are a little out of date, many of the concepts still apply and are very useful.

BepInEx plugins or BepInPlugins are an alternative for Partiality hook mods. For more info, see the [BepInPlugin page](/pages/making-code-mods/BepInPlguins.html).
