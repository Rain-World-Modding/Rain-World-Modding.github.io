<h1>Creating New Objects</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>This page is a WIP</strong></p>
<p>There's an assortment of items that can be placed with the power of dev tools, but what if you wanted more? RegionKit is a plugin currently in development that will allow such objects to be distributed with ease, [ something like &quot;in the meantime&quot;, but I don't really know what time scale the project is on ].</p>
<hr />
<h2>Main Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>A 'main' class that inherits from <code>UpdatableAndDeletable</code> (and <code>IDrawable</code> if you want it to have sprites)</li>
<li>A representation class that inherits from <code>DevInterface.PlacedObjectRepresentation</code>; provides the options box for the object in the object view of dev tools<ul>
<li>You may also want this to have child classes to handle custom controls for your object's options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A data class that inherits from <code>PlacedObject.Data</code>; this stores the options that the representation class tweaks</li>
<li>A hook for <code>Room.Loaded</code></li>
<li>A hook for <code>PlacedObject.GenerateEmptyData</code>; this will handle instantiating your object's data class</li>
<li>A hook for <code>DevInterface.ObjectsPage.CreateObjRep</code>; this will handle instantiating both your UpdateableAndDeleteable and representation classes</li>
</ul>
