<h1>Adding A New Region</h1>
<hr />
<h2>*<strong><u>This article is outdated and needs updating!</u></strong>*</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a two letter acronym for your region. For these examples we'll use XX</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the file &quot;Rain World/World/Regions/regions.txt&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add your two letter acronym to the end of the file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new folder in the Regions directory with your two letter acronym</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy files over from one of the other regions to use as a template</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rename instances of the old region's acronym to your new region's acronym</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6a. I recommend blanking out the map_XX file entirely</p>
<p>6b. Remove all Room_Attr lines from the Properties file</p>
<p>6c. Delete everything from the Rooms folder, leaving just one room to use as your start map to build off of.</p>
<p>6d. Blank out most of the ROOMS and CREATURES sections from the <a href="World-File-Format.html">world_XX</a> file.
    	- If you want Vultures/Leviathans/Scavengers in your region, leave the OFFSCREEN section under CREATURES
    		- You'll add a couple lines under ROOM for connecting the gate and your start room, so your region at least has SOMETHING in it (once you make the gate).</p>
<h2>Adding the Gate</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the &quot;Rain World/World/Gates&quot; folder</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take one of the gates in here to use as a base, and copy/paste it</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rename the copies to match your region connection. For example, if you're connecting to SU, name the files GATE_SU_XX</p>
</li>
<li><p>You'll also need to open the GATE_YY_XX.txt file and edit the first line of the file to match</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the file &quot;Rain World/World/Gates/locks.txt&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a new line for your new gate, and specify the karma requirements for the two sides of the gate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go back to each of the two regions and add connections to the gate in their world_XX.txt files</p>
</li>
</ol>
