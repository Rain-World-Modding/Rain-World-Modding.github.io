<h1>Level Editor: Effect Editor</h1>
<hr />
<p><img src="../../../assets/regionDevelopment/levelEditor/effectEditor.png" alt="effectEditor" /></p>
<p>The effect editor is used to modify and add filters to the level's geometry and tiles. This is the main way you make your levels &quot;look good.&quot; It is largely up for you to paint the effects that will fill your rooms, and all of these effects can be seen in a large gallery picture at the end of the article. However there are a few pointers that hold true for most rooms in Rain World.</p>
<ul>
<li>Slime is your friend. Most of Rain World has a light to medium dose of slime all over the room. This effects adds a more messy drippy border to the details of your room, and prevents it from looking too clean.</li>
<li>BlackGoo is used to create the black outlines to rooms. Apply this effect before the slime is applied if you want a more messy border! Applies in large blots over certain tiles, and will not appear over empty tiles. This effect only applies to layer 1, and will NOT draw on: Random machines, trash, and the smallpipes materials. It will also not draw on almost all tiles.</li>
<li>Dirt and large trash make good material borders for natural rooms where you want the black goo to appear.</li>
<li>Large trash covered in black goo works well for the borders of machinery inside walls, and mechanical areas.</li>
<li>Concrete blocks, and large trash work well for the borders of more urban areas. However the more blocky materials are often a bit harder to make look good. Don't be discouraged, keep playing around until you are happy with the effects and tiles!</li>
<li>Some effects work best with certain tiles, and certain effects require certain tiles under them to properly be applied. ( Such as ceramic chaos effect, requiring the ceramic tile material on the walls!)</li>
<li>Unlike other effects, the BlackGoo effect starts applied to the whole room. Instead of using left-click to paint it in, use right-click to erase the areas you don't want it to apply to.</li>
</ul>
