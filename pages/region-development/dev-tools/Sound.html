<p>This is a single tab for the <a href="Dev-Tools.html">Dev Tools.</a> See that page for more controls and other tabs.</p>
<p>This editor tab allows you to place various sounds into the room. Omni-directional sounds will play regardless of your location in the room, and from all directions. Directional sound is similar, you can control the direction the player will hear the sound from their speakers in. Finally spot sounds will play from a specific location in the room, with a configurable fading distance. All sounds can have their pitches and volume tweaked to fit the mood of the room. Take a peak at rooms in the vanilla game to get a sense of how loud sounds normally are in game.</p>
